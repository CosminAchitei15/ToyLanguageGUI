# 1. Introduction
   This is a language interpreter made from scratch during my "Advanced Methods of Programming" class. It features a list of precoded programs, and you can watch each of those programs executed instruction by instruction.

# 2. Concepts used
    - Layered architecture
    - MVC pattern
    - JavaFX
    - Java interfaces & streams
---
# 3. GUI Features
   - Execution Stack - see the line of code that will run next
   - Symbol Table - contains the name and the value of the variables which were initialized during execution
   - File Table - for r/w operations on text files
   - Program state list and count - this language interpreter has the `fork()` instruction implemented, you can select the process you want to look at.
   - Output List - list of values that get printed out to the console during execution
   - Heap - the language interpreter supports heap r/w operations

  - relational expressions
  - variable declaration & assignment, including conditional assignment
  - print statement
  - if statement
  - while loop
  - file opening, closing and reading
  - fork (multi-threading)
